## Basic Use

In its simplest use, the Pitch component can be used to wrap the name of a pitch
and replace pseudo accidental symbols (# and b) with the correct musical
symbols. It supports upper and lower-case pitch letters, accidentals from triple
flat to triple sharp, and an optional octave number. If you try some other text,
it will throw an error.

A few examples:

- `<Pitch>d6</Pitch>` &rarr; <Pitch>d6</Pitch>
- `<Pitch>C#</Pitch>` &rarr; <Pitch>C#</Pitch>
- `<Pitch>Gb4</Pitch>` &rarr; <Pitch>Gb4</Pitch>
- `<Pitch>bbb6</Pitch>` &rarr; <Pitch>bbb6</Pitch>
- `<Pitch>D###</Pitch>` &rarr; <Pitch>D###</Pitch>
