import { Pitch } from '@musedlab/symbols/pitch';
```

## Basic Use

In its simplest use, the Pitch component can be used to wrap the name of a pitch
and replace pseudo accidental symbols ("#" and "b") with the correct musical
symbols. It supports upper and lower-case pitch letters, accidentals from triple
flat to triple sharp, and an optional octave number. If you try some other text,
it will throw an error.

A few examples:

- `<Pitch>d6</Pitch>` &rarr; <Pitch>d6</Pitch>
- `<Pitch>C#</Pitch>` &rarr; <Pitch>C#</Pitch>
- `<Pitch>Gb4</Pitch>` &rarr; <Pitch>Gb4</Pitch>
- `<Pitch>bbb6</Pitch>` &rarr; <Pitch>bbb6</Pitch>
- `<Pitch>D###</Pitch>` &rarr; <Pitch>D###</Pitch>

## Use With Numeric Pitches

- `<Pitch midi={7} />` &rarr; <Pitch midi={7} />
- `<Pitch pitchClass={7} />` &rarr; <Pitch pitchClass={7} />

### Enharmonics

Non-natural notes are written using sharps by default, but you can use the
optional `enharmonic` prop to specify which spelling of the note name to use:

- `<Pitch midi={66}` /> &rarr; <Pitch midi={66} />
- `<Pitch midi={66} enharmonic="sharp" />` &rarr;
  <Pitch midi={66} enharmonic="sharp" />
- `<Pitch midi={66} enharmonic="flat" />` &rarr;
  <Pitch midi={66} enharmonic="flat" />

### Ambiguous Enharmonics

You can also set `enharmonic="both"` to render both enharmonics

### Scales

Another way to control spelling is to pass an array of pitches to the `scale`
prop. For example, if you've defined the following scale:

```js
// Lydian Dominant in C
const lydianDom = ['C', 'D', 'E', 'F#', 'G', 'A', 'Bb'];
```

export const lydianDom = ['C', 'D', 'E', 'F#', 'G', 'A', 'Bb'];

`<Pitch midi={66} scale={lydianDom} />` will render
"<Pitch midi={66} scale={lydianDom} />", while
`<Pitch midi={70} scale={lydianDom} />` will render
"<Pitch midi={70} scale={lydianDom} />"
